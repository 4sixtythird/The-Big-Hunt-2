## The Big Hunt 2 - (A scavenger hunt for the internet)

This is a fun mini-game designed and tailored towards my friend group.

### How to play

This game consists of many types of Question and Answer stages.
The friend group will be split into two teams, and each team will race to answer the questions and finish the hunt first.

### The code

The code is written in the new NEXT.js framework which uses the app router update. This app is coded to be simple and easy to use.
There is not much complecity to the code, nor is there any need for it.
This web app meets all design requirements and intentions.
A lot of the code is hard coded and copy & pasted. However, this same template can be used in the future with more/different questions.
